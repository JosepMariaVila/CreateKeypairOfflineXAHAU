Step by step guide to set up the wallet:

Create an empty folder in your desktop and download the 4 files.

It works for the XAHAU Mainnet.

It allows to create a Keypair Mainnet account (which has to be activated later with XAHAU). DO IT OFFLINE, it's purely mathematical.

Once you have created it offline that wallet can receive XAH. Warning: if you use this wallet to perform a transaction ONLINE like sending XAH, then the private key will become compromised so you should create again a new wallet offline and send your XAH there. These wallets are secure just if you don't perform transactions online with the computer where the key pair has been generated.
